## 1. MemOS Knowledge Base vs Traditional RAG

MemOS Knowledge Base supports developers in integrating business knowledge into the long-term memory system of intelligent applications.
<br>
The system uses uploaded documents as the underlying data source to build and maintain an independent memory layer, supporting natural language interaction applications such as Q&A. As end-users continue to use it, MemOS dynamically evolves and updates memories based on conversation content, thereby promoting automatic iteration and self-evolution of the knowledge base.
<br>
<br>
Unlike the static storage of traditional RAG, MemOS makes the knowledge base part of "memory". AI applications with "memory" can not only query information more accurately but also better understand the background and the user. Let's look at two real scenarios to compare the two solutions:

<br>

**Shopping Customer Service Robot**

**Background**

```python
DAY 1 User asks: I have a three-month-old Golden Retriever. Which dog food is better? By the way, it doesn't eat chicken flavor.
DAY 1 User bought A lamb puppy food under the assistant's recommendation.
DAY 10 User asks: The dog has diarrhea eating this dog food. I want to change to another one.
```

**RAG Solution**

```python
# Retrieve snippets related to "puppy food recommendation" and "diarrhea" based on user input, but fail to recall "user's dog doesn't eat chicken flavor". Retrieved knowledge:

1. Common reasons for dog food diarrhea: Can switch to hypoallergenic dog food.
2. Hypoallergenic puppy food recommendation: B (Chicken), C (Salmon).

# 🤦 Shopping Assistant: If diarrhea occurs now, you can try B (Chicken flavor), C (Salmon).
```

**MemOS Solution**

```python
# Retrieve relevant memories based on user input, perceive that the user's dog is a three-month-old Golden Retriever puppy, dislikes chicken, and needs a recommendation for puppy food that won't cause diarrhea. Retrieved memories:

1. The user has a three-month-old Golden Retriever weighing about 12 catties.
2. The user's dog does not eat chicken-flavored dog food.
3. The user previously purchased lamb puppy food.
4. Common reasons for dog food diarrhea: Can switch to hypoallergenic dog food.
5. Hypoallergenic puppy food recommendation: B (Chicken), C (Salmon).

# ✅ Shopping Assistant: You mentioned before that the dog is a 3-month-old Golden Retriever and cannot eat chicken flavor, so I have excluded all chicken-flavored puppy foods for you. You bought lamb + salmon puppy food before. If diarrhea occurs now, you can try the milder C (Salmon Puppy Hypoallergenic).
```
<br>
<br>

**Enterprise Knowledge Base Assistant**

**Background**

```python
DAY 1 Employee asks: My computer is a MacBook Pro 13-inch, Intel chip. How do I install the company intranet proxy?
DAY 1 Assistant provided the installation steps for the Intel version.
DAY 20 Employee asks: The intranet proxy won't open. Which version should I reinstall?
```

**RAG Solution**

```python
# Retrieve content related to "intranet proxy" and "won't open" based on user input, but fail to recall "user's device model". Retrieved knowledge:

1. Intranet proxy common troubleshooting
2. Intranet proxy installation instructions for M1/M2 (ARM) versions
3. Windows intranet proxy client installation instructions
4. Network connection and certificate issues
5. General FAQ

# 🤦 Knowledge Base Assistant: Please try to re-download and install the latest Mac M1/M2 (ARM) version or Windows intranet proxy client. Here are the installation steps: ...
```

**MemOS Solution**

```python
# Retrieve memories related to "intranet proxy" and "won't open" based on the employee's question, automatically identify the employee's device model. Retrieved memories:

1. The user installed the company intranet proxy 20 days ago, and his device is MacBook Pro 13 (Intel).
2. Intranet proxy common troubleshooting
3. Intranet proxy installation instructions for Intel version

# ✅ Knowledge Base Assistant: You are using a MacBook Pro with an Intel chip. It is recommended to reinstall the Intel version of the intranet proxy client. Here are the download link and installation steps for the Intel version: ...
```

::note{icon="ri:triangular-flag-fill"}
**&nbsp;Advantage Summary**<br>
RAG is good at retrieving information semantically similar to the query from the knowledge base, but it is **stateless**: every query is independent, lacking understanding of the specific user and context.<br>

MemOS can understand information such as **relationships, time, and preferences**, linking current questions with historical memories, and finding and using knowledge with "context":<br>

* **Understand Users**: MemOS knows "who you are" and "what you are doing". Just ask a question, and MemOS will automatically complete the context.<br>

* **Personalization**: For different positions and work habits, MemOS can remember "this client dislikes overly aggressive sales", "you use Python more often than Java", "you consulted the reimbursement policy last time, do you need to enter the application process this time".<br>

* **Knowledge Evolution**: When there are "rules of thumb" not written in documents in the actual process, MemOS will precipitate them into new memories, continuously supplementing and perfecting the knowledge system.
::


## 2. How it Works

1.  **Upload**: Create a knowledge base and upload documents via the console or API.

2.  **Validation**: Complete authentication and verify compliance of document format, size, etc.

3.  **Storage**: After successful upload, documents are saved by MemOS and enter the processing queue.

4.  **Parsing**: Parse original document content according to different file types.

5.  **Intelligent Segmentation**: Split documents into finer-grained content fragments based on title, structure, and semantics.

6.  **Generate Memory**: MemOS generates knowledge memories based on fragments, forming a complete project memory bank together with user long-term memories.

7.  **Embedding and Indexing**: Write all memory content into the database and establish embedding indexes to support millisecond-level retrieval.


## 3. Knowledge Base Requirements

### Capacity Limits

MemOS Cloud Service currently offers multiple pricing plans from free to enterprise versions for all developers. Different versions have different limits on knowledge base capacity and quantity.

::note
Currently, all versions are free for a limited time. Welcome to [Official Website - Pricing](https://memos.openmem.net/cn/pricing) to apply for the version that suits your needs.
::

| **Version**   | **Knowledge Base Storage Limit**                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Free** | Knowledge Base Count: 10; Single KB Storage: 1G    |
| **Starter** | Knowledge Base Count: 30; Single KB Storage: 10G   |
| **Pro** | Knowledge Base Count: 100; Single KB Storage: 100G |


::warning
&nbsp;Note<br>
When your service level is downgraded, if the existing knowledge base exceeds the capacity limit of the current version, MemOS **will not clear existing knowledge base data**, but will restrict the following operations:<br>

* Cannot create new knowledge bases
* Cannot continue to upload new documents

Relevant functions will be restored after usage is adjusted to within the capacity range of the current version.
::

### Document Limits

1.  Supported document types: PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT

2.  Single file size limit: Not exceeding 100 MB, 500 pages

3.  Single upload file quantity limit: Not exceeding 20

::warning
&nbsp;Note<br>
When the number of files, single file size, or number of pages in a single upload exceeds the above limits, the upload task will be judged as **processing failed**.<br>
Please adjust the files according to the requirements and re-initiate the upload request.
::

## 4. Usage Example

### Feedback to Optimize Knowledge Base

In enterprises, it is common for company policies/knowledge to be updated while the knowledge base is not updated in time. Currently, MemOS supports feedback on knowledge base memories through **natural language conversation**, used to quickly update knowledge base memories, thereby improving accuracy and timeliness.

Try it out, drive the knowledge base to always stay up-to-date with the simplest interaction method.
